Here's some light context about me:

- Designer, mediocre dev, anthropologist
- Design engineer at a research and design agency called Normally. We do early-stage design and
  prototyping work. Mostly exploratory AI products and capabilities for larger companies.
- Enthusiastic about visual programming, EUP, metaphors.

Who here has heard the phrase “tools for thought”?

Considering this is a lecture series on tools for augmented thinking and you are mostly MIT people,
I’m going to be talking to you as potential creators of tools for thought, even if you don’t know
much about this specific phrase yet. I’ll get into it’s meaning and history in a minute.

I’m also going to assume a little more computer science background than most other places, but I’ll
give you all links and citations to everything I mention at the end so you can look it up later.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-4.jpeg" >

Tools for thought is a few things

It’s first and foremost a philosophical dream with a long history. About what happens when you give
humans really well designed tools that expand the kind of thoughts they’re able to think.

Second, in recent years, it’s become a gathering point.It unifies a number of otherwise disparate
fields.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-5.jpeg" >

And most interestingly, over the last 5 years, it’s become a category of software in the
spreadsheets of VC firms and a thing that they’re willing to throw cash at

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-6.jpeg" >

The recent hype around this phrase first starting building in 2019.

Around the time that two fairly well-known researchers - Andy Matuschak and Michael Neilson - wrote
this very long, comprehensive essay on the history of tools for thought, which gave it lot of
renewed interest.

In it they gave readers a sweep through a lot of major thinkers and events in computing history like
Douglas Engelbart’s work and Alan Kay, and made a plea for more people to start exploring this space
of computing systems that augment the human intellect.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-7.jpeg" >

Around the same time (2019) a new note taking app called Roam Research stared to gain traction and
aligned itself with this phrase “tools for thought”.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-8.jpeg" >

It looked pretty ugly, and had terrible performance, but it did some things that _at the time_
seemed novel:

- Bidirectional links or backlinks
- Used an outliner format where each piece of content is a single node that can be linked to any
  other node and embedded anywhere else in the graph.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-9.jpeg" >

They also has this crazy graph view that showed you connections between all your notes And the whole
thing was multiplayer.

The founder were experimenting with what seemed like novel ways of interacting with hypertext (but
you might recognise some of these are quite old). Had precedence in the 80s and 90s, particularly
Ted Nelson’s work on Xanadu.

Roam was trying to resurface these. And they had a compelling goal: giving people better tools for
developing ideas collaboratively and synthesising them. Trying to enable bottom-up thinking and
emergence.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-10.jpeg">

Roam kicked off a bit of a note-taking hype cycle. Suddenly we got a bunch of new note-taking
startups that all proclaimed to be new tools for thought

This is Muse - more canvas and drawing based

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-11.jpeg">

Anytype - more focused on structured data

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-12.jpeg">

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-13.jpeg">

Reflect promising you can “think better” with this. Even if they don’t use the phrase “tools for
thought” directly, creators of these tools understood they were now supposed to be in the business
of making people think better

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-14.jpeg">

Logseq promising increasing understanding

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-16.jpeg">

There’s a bunch more of these - all released within the last 5 years, with the exception of Notion.

The phrase now feels synonymous with these experimental note-taking apps.

All promising their features would lead to better thinking; better quality thoughts, better memory,
and more emergent connections between topics

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-17.jpeg">

We also got an endless pile of influencers making YouTube videos teaching you how to use these apps
and setup elaborate organisational systems

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-18.jpeg">

This surge in interested let to more funding. Betaworks hosted an accelerator for a dozen tools for
thought companies in New York

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-20.jpeg">

Essentially, Tools for thought became an idea machine Idea machines are a concept Nadia Asparouhova
coined in an essay in 2022.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-19.jpeg">

This means an ideology with backed by raw, tangible resources. Meaning people, companies, software,
and money. She used examples like effective altruism or Web3, but frankly I think the Catholic
Church also counts.

They are ideas with power behind them. Something we can name and point at and gather resources
around.

And I’m glad tools for thought has become a financially-backed, powerful movement, because it’s a
worthwhile cause.

BUT, I think the current understanding of it has some limitations and needs some redirection.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-21.jpeg">

So here’s the big question this talk is asking. What if we consider…

I’m coming at this from an anthropology and design perspective And I’m very much part of the
community of people using and building this kind of software. I was an early user of Roam. I know a
lot of the people building these TFT companies, so I feel obliged to critically interrogate it a
bit.

The term and the community around it has grown significant enough that we’re all walking around with
a lot of assumptions about the meaning and mission of this phrase, and what kind of work it
requires.

But thinking about different ways we might interpret this term could lead us down very different
paths about what we choose to work on and choose to build

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-22.jpeg">

So one of the first critical questions we should ask is what does TFT have to do with computers? The
phrase itself implies nothing about computation or digital objects

It’s simply tools that helps humans think new kinds of thoughts

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-23.jpeg">

If we take that definition at face value, and try to come up with examples of TFT, we’d have to
conclude most of them precede computing by thousands of years

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-26.jpeg">

All of these are pre-computational

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-27.jpeg">

Hindu-arabic numerals made accounting and record keeping possible. Calculations could be stored,
shared, and referenced Enabled all bureaucracy since.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-28.jpeg">

We’ve used poetry and song to extend memory and pass stories between generations before written
language

Bards used rhetorical techniques and metric rhythm to make the stories easy to recite.

It’s how pieces like the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Mahabrata survived long enough to eventually be
written down

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-29.jpeg">

Maps enabled humans to mentally navigate space differently - gave us allocentric views vs.
egocentric.

We're able to construct mental models of much larger spaces that we can't directly see

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-30.jpeg">

Cartesian coordinates; famously developed by Rene Descartes after watching a fly circle around his
room

Made us able to describe points in space with specific numbers. Allows us to model objects that
don’t exist with accuracy. Allows us to precisely map and refer to points on the earth. Led to GPS.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-31.jpeg">

Zettelkasten (slip box) A technique from around the 18th century where you write atomic notes on
individual index cards and keep them all in a large box or “slip box”. You assign each card an ID,
and use those to link cards together to create deeply interconnected ideas.

Pre-cursor to deeply linked content we have with hyperlinking.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-32.jpeg">

But this is primarily a list of cultural practices and systems; they are techniques – a way of doing
things - that enable us to relate to information and representation in new ways. Thus enabling new
kinds of thoughts.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-33.jpeg">

They aren’t technological objects like hammers or compasses. They’re practices that people developed
and passed down to one another through culture.

Most of the things we’re all enamoured with in the current software moment around tools for thought
are actually the practices we do inside the new tools, rather than the tools themselves

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-34.jpeg">

Most of the YouTube thought leaders turn out to be teaching specific practices – like building a
Zettelkasten – rather than teaching us specific software.

And it’s unclear how much enabling the software is doing vs. the cultural practice

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-35.jpeg">

The same goes for spaced repetition - there are guides on how to do it in every platform imaginable.

But we can’t quite tell if the app or the practice is what’s enabling people to improve their memory

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-36.jpeg">

So we’re in an interesting place; all this software is being called tools for thought And most of
the community is focused on building more software

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-37.jpeg">

But it seems like these cultural practices are the real tools for thought

What we’re exploring with here is the relationship between the computer as a medium and the cultural
practices we do within the medium. And which one of those we should be focusing on…

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-38.jpeg">

So we’re still on this question. What does any of this have to do with computers?

To understand why we’re confused it’s worth going back to the origins of the phrase and the people
who proposed we should start paying attention to the idea.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-39.jpeg">

TFT as a concept is rooted in computer science and HCI.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-40.jpeg">

The first person to use the phrase was Kenneth Iverson talked about tools for thought throughout the
1950s-1960s wrote “Notation as a Tool for Thought, published by the ACM in 1980

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-41.jpeg">

Talking about mathematical notation as the best known and best developed example of a tool for
thought.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-42.jpeg">

Around the same time period of the 1950’s and 60’s Douglas Englebart wrote “Augmenting the Human
Intellect”

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-43.jpeg">

His thesis was computers should help us approach complex situations

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-44.jpeg">

Alan Kay picked up a lot of this Philosophy and applied it while developing the foundations of most
of our current computing environments at Xerox PARC Wrote a paper called “User Interface: A Personal
View” in 1989 where he talked about his vision of the potential of computational mediums

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-45.jpeg">

Summed up in this quote

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-46.jpeg">

There’s a book called ‘tools for thought’ Howard Rheingold wrote a comprehensive summary of this
history in his 1985 book A lot about the birth of personal computers and many of the people I just
mentioned TFT went a bit quiet in the 90’s, not a lot written

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-47.jpeg">

Around 2013 Bret Victor starts doing talks For the newer generation his work becomes canon. The
Humane Representation of Thought, and Media for Thinking the Unthinkable between 2013-2015

All of these programmers are pushing this idea that we need to be building new tools for thought.
And most of the people listening to them or reading their work are computer people. And so we end up
assuming the problem is a computer-shaped problem.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-48.jpeg">

Another interesting thing about the way these programmers are talking about “tools for thought” is
that they're actually talking about a medium for thought, not a tool.

For philosophical clarity, these two are different

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-49.jpeg">

Mediums are a material we use to communicate ideas: film, painting, writing, photography

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-50.jpeg">

Whereas tools enable specific workflows.

You don’t communicate through a hammer or agile. They’re part of a larger context – the medium.

I think it’s important to be clear on the different between these two, but when we talk about “tools
for thought” as a category of things humans have used to expand their thinking, both are part of
that picture

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-51.jpeg">

I think its more accurate to say the thinkers I referenced so far are talking about a computational
medium for thought.

Where the computer-ness and medium-ness are critical elements

It should be CMFT, rather than TFT

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-52.jpeg">

Also clear than CMFT is a subset of TFT If TFT is all the tools and mediums that expand the range of
human thought, this community is specifically talking about the computer medium type

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-53.jpeg">

So what’s so special about computers?

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-54.jpeg">

I think this is best answered in this Alan Kay quote

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-55.jpeg">

Encoding cultural practices in computation reconfigures, expands, and transforms them

The meta-medium changes the practice

We have to acknowledge there’s something very different about computing - in its ability to create
representations of the world that we can explore and manipulate, freed from many of the constraints
of physical materials.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-56.jpeg">

If we think about a Zettelkasten, which is a form of note-taking I mentioned earlier.

I think it would be slightly absurd to deny the fact a digital zettelkasten or note-taking system
has very different affordance to a physical zettelkasten. Even if they’re based on the same cultural
practices.

The computational version changes what we’re able to do. Clearly expands our capacity in some way

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-57.jpeg">

But even though computing expands some of the practices in new ways, we shouldn’t forget we're still
recreating cultural practices that first exist outside computing.

Maps and spreadsheets and zettelkastens all existed before computers.

Computing as an amplifier or enabler

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-58.jpeg">

At the moment there is a LOT of staring, hard at the computer. Thinking about what the computer can
do. Thinking about software and interfaces and novel ways to store and retrieve data Which is
necessary… to some extent. But there’s not a lot of attention put on the cultural practices we're
trying to represent

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-59.jpeg">

We’re currently enabling a fairly small range of activities.

Primarily:

- capturing information (and much debate over which specific format to capture it in and where that
  data lives)
- Organising information. This includes linking, tagging, categorising it.
- Retrieving information. This means search, and being able to find the right information at the
  right time. Having relevant information appear when you need it
- Remembering information. These are the spaced repetition systems.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-60.jpeg">

- Searching for new information.
- Synthesising ideas.
- Generating ideas.

I’d argue we’re not very good at these last three at the moment, but that's primarily a lot of what
people are trying to get AI and language models to do. I’ll come back to AI in a bit.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-61.jpeg">

These actives all serve a particular flavour of knowledge work.

Work that is based around research and written output with a textual focus. Helping people write
documents and code and presentation slides.

Good for academics, social scientists, strategists, journalists, teachers, consultants, VC,
Twittering thought leaders, and (unsurprisingly) programmers.

We’re mostly designing for ourselves.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-62.jpeg">

At the moment, it feels like we’re not exploring computational mediums for thought, as much as we’re
exploring a subset of it I’m going to call… Computational mediums for White-collar knowledge work.
Of CMfWKW for convenience

Clear we need to expand our view of this field a little.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-63.jpeg">

The big question is how do we help the tools for thought community diversify?

How do we help move the community beyond computers for text-based white-collar knowledge work?

I have three overarching ideas of how we can start to do this.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-64.jpeg">

If we’re trying to look at what enables novel kinds of human thought, to me that’s an
anthropological and cognitive science question, not a computing question.

At the moment most people in this space are trying innovate without learning much about the world
outside of software, or the even outside the world of cool hyperlinks in web apps.

I think the field would benefit from a much wider lens on the problem.

Specifically, theories like embodied cognition, extended mind theory, and looking at examples of
cross-cultural ways of thinking from ethnographic research could add a lot to our conception of
tools for thought.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-65.jpeg">

To name just a few, we could look at the work of philosophers like Andy Clark, who's written
extensively about about how human cognition interacts with the environments around us.

This book “Natural Born Cyborgs” might look a bit dated, but all the content inside it is still
extremely prescient and relevant. It's not his only book on the subject, but I think it's one of the
more accessible ones.

In it, Clark presents the extended mind hypothesis that says we don't think inside of our brains,
but we think in the relationship between our brains, our bodies and the world around us.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-66.jpeg">

George Lakoff’s research on embodied metaphors as the foundation of all conceptual thought

This book is short, it's pretty readable, and it will make you rethink the way you understand how
abstract thought is constructed.

Lakoff and Johnson argue that everything is grounded in our embodied experience of the world, which
certainly has implications for AI, but again I will not get into that now.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-67.jpeg">

Similarly, Barbara Tversky has done an extensive amount of research on how thinking happens through
the body and through action and motion in the body.

Both this book and almost any of the existing research on embodied cognition will convince you that
the way humans think is deeply tied to our physical interactions with the world around us, and our
understanding space, colour, light, sound, texture, and rich visual inputs.I imagine none of this is
news to your research group. You know bodies are important. But not everyone does.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-68.jpeg">

Some notable others include anthropologist Tim Ingold who's done an enormous amount of work on how
humans build techniques and skills in relationship with the environment they live within.

There's also Bruno Latour, another anthropologist who worked on actor network theory. Maurice
Merleau-Ponty, very famous for setting the foundations of embodied cognition. Marshall McLuhan for
talking about the relationship between mediums and communication. And I'm sure you all know, Don
Norman came up with the idea of cognitive artefacts.

This is not a comprehensive list, but a good starting point. I think one of the most useful things
we could as the Tools for Thought community is to spread around the knowledge that these thinkers
have established and use it more as the foundation of our work.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-69.jpeg">

And the reason I think we're not doing that at the moment is because I look around and have to ask,
where are all the embodied visual, spatial, and aural tools for thought?

Professions that primarily work in non-textual mediums are unlikely to find the “tools for thought”
we’re currently offering as profoundly helpful.

We of course of have software that serves some of these disciplines very well; spreadsheets for
mathematics, 3D modelling for biologists, data science, photoshop for painters, logic pro for
musicians. But strangely these don’t show up a lot in the tools for thought community.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-70.jpeg">

To give you some examples of what I mean, I would consider AlphaFold from DeepMind, a good example
of non-textual, spatial tool for thought.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-71.jpeg">

Jacob Collier. Grammy-winning musician showing an extraordinarily complex breakdown of his song Moon
River in logic pro.

Over an hour, but an exceptional example a computation medium enabling wildly different kinds of
musical thought.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-72.jpeg">

New image generators for visual brainstorming and exploring visual culture

These are images from Midjourney. Image generators are controversial for other reasons like copyright, but
as a creative thinking tool, I think they’re worth exploring.

We still have to figure out how to get more fine grained control over the outputs. But its very
promising.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-73.jpeg">

VR obviously exploring embodied cognition side of things

Prisms VR for spatial reasoning with maths

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-74.jpeg">

Prisms VR for spatial reasoning with maths

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-75.jpeg">

On that note… It’s funny to be in the current moment of the AI hype bubble, where the professed goal
of burning all these GPUs is to invent thinking machines.

People hope to make these machines reason and problem solve better than humans can and solve all our
complex problems.

And yet we've gone about it by an intensely disembodied and textual technique, by literally only
dumping text into these models, so that all they know is text.

Language models – the primary kind of AI most people are putting the most stock in – lack an
understand of bodies, objects, and environments interacting in space and over time. Which the
literature shows is core to the way humans think.

That doesn’t mean they won’t produce useful tools for us, but they will not recreate anything
resembling human thinking and problem solving. At least not without giving them some way to
understand embodiment and motion and interaction with the physical world.

So just consider that next time someone tells you that GPT-5 is going to solve climate change.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-76.jpeg">

The second way to diversify tools for thought is to build complementary, not competitive artefacts

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-77.jpeg">

This theory comes from David Krakauer of the Santa Fe Institute.

Competitive artefacts do the cognitive work for you and hide their workings. So when you take the
tool away, you've actually diminished your skills because you haven't been practicing it. They
compete with us in a way.

While complementary artefacts teach you new cognitive skills through using the tool. They complement
your abilities and they make you more capable even when you don't have the tool with you.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-78.jpeg">

A good example of this is Google Maps versus a compass

Using Google Maps doesn't make you better at navigating the world around you. It tells you exactly
where to go without relating it to local landmarks or the position of the sun or helping you develop
a sense of direction in the world. If you take Google Maps away, none of us are better at navigating
our cities.

Whereas a compass makes you look up more, makes you pay attention to the physical world around you,
and teaches you how to relate the direction you're in to the physical world you're seeing via
landmarks like the sun. It teaches you navigation skills that would remain if we took the compass
away.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-79.jpeg">

One prescient example at the moment is coding assistants like Copilot.

I think used in some ways these could be complementary, but the vast majority of uses I've seen of
them are actually competitive. They're not helping you learn how to solve programming problems
yourself, especially if you're not reading the code that they output.

It would be interesting to try to redesign copilot and focus a making it a complementary tool that
slowly teaches you programmatic thinking versus doing things like applying large code chunks to
files or rewriting entire files for you.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-80.jpeg">

Third thing I think is missing is the whole mission of this talk

I think we need to pay much more attention to cultural practices, not computational objects.

There are tons of pre-existing, super effective cultural practices that make us better at thinking.
And we should be considering how we could enable more people to use them. Perhaps with computers,
but perhaps not.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-81.jpeg">

Just to give you a few examples of some under explored ones:

- Spatial memory. We have extremely effective memories when we relate facts to physical space. I
  haven't seen that much exploration of designing tools to help people build memory palaces.
- Classical rhetoric. This is how the ancient Greeks and Romans developed convincing arguments. We
  could build tools that teach us how to use ethos, pathos, and logos. And bring in more
  alliteration and antithesis and analogies.
- Critical thinking skills. This is a huge category. What tools do we have that help us question and
  interrogate claims we come across? And get us to question our assumptions and prove ourselves
  wrong? And point out our unconscious biases and logical fallacies?
- Statistics and statistical manipulation. We all famously know statistics are mostly lies. But
  being able to understand and interpret statistics is an incredibly powerful tool to understand big
  data. And I think most of us, me included, are pretty illiterate in statistics. I would love tools
  that help me correctly interpret and put into context data that I encounter on a daily basis.
- Information literacy skills. Obviously shown to be pretty low across the population. And getting
  worse as AI Slop fills every single online platform. Do any of your current tools help thoroughly
  vet the sources and legitimacy of information you encounter throughout the day? Do they help you
  compare and contrast arguments you read and come to more informed and synthesised conclusions? No!
  Or at least mine don’t. If yours do, I want to know what apps you’re using.

There's lots of places to look for more practices like these. Daniel Bennett has a bunch of good
examples of these in his book “Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking”. He wasn’t explicitly
referencing any of the pre-existing computational literature on TFT when he wrote this.

The way he thinks about TFT is similar to what I proposed at the beginning; cites words, numbers,
maps, diagrams. But, being he philosopher, he is especially interested in “intuition pumps” which is
his own term meaning reasoning moves that help you think critically about philosophical problems.
These include following Rapport’s rules, Joosting, and Rathering. If you want to know what those
are, you’ll have to read the book.

In other words, we should be building tools that give people new lenses on the world. That teach you
how to see and think in useful new ways.

I know a lot of the examples I showed probably fall under the category of critical thinking lenses.
But you could also teach people to see through an emotional lens, or see the world through the lens
of complexity theory and emergence. To me, these are the most promising “tools for thought.”
